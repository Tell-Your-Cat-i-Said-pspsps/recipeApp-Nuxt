Nuxt Recipe App

This is a modern, responsive recipe web application built with Nuxt 3 / Nuxt 4 File structure and TypeScript that helps users discover, view, and explore recipes easily. It integrates several key features and design principles:

    Component-driven architecture: Reusable UI components like RecipeCard, BaseBtn, and BaseNavigation create a clean and maintainable codebase.

    Dynamic routing: Recipes are accessed via dynamic routes ([id].vue) that fetch recipe details from an external API.

    Type safety: Uses TypeScript interfaces (types.ts) to define the shape of recipe data, improving code reliability.

    SEO optimization: Pages set meaningful SEO and social metadata dynamically for better search engine ranking and social sharing previews.

    Responsive design: The layout and components adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop.

    State-of-the-art image handling: Uses NuxtImg for optimized image loading and responsive sizes.

    Error handling: Custom error page to gracefully handle and show API or routing errors.

    Clean UI/UX: Includes navigation, call-to-action buttons, and user-friendly layouts designed with utility-first CSS (likely Tailwind).

Core pages include:

    Home / Recipes listing: Showcases a hero banner and a grid of popular recipes.

    Recipe detail: Displays individual recipe info like ingredients, instructions, nutrition, and ratings.

    Error page: Friendly UI for error scenarios.

Overall, the app provides a polished, user-friendly experience for exploring recipes and is built with scalable and maintainable Nuxt 3 best practices.
